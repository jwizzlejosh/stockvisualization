# stockvisualization

This program uses the yfinance API to extract current stock data and visualize it using Pandas and MatPlotLib


## History

I made this program in Dec 2021, to practice data visualization with Pandas and MatPlotLib. 
## Status

I would like to expand this project in the future with a GUI and more detailed charting and even fiancial indicators.
