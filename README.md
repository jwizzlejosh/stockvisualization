# stockvisualization

This program uses the yfinance library to extract current stock data and visualize it using Pandas and MatPlotLib.


## Usage

I made this program in Dec 2021, to practice data visualization with Pandas and MatPlotLib. This was one of my first independent projects where I explored using different libraries and I learned more about data visualization and using these libraries specifically.


*Due to incompatibility with my ARM Macbook Air, this project is discontinued however in the future, I would like to expand this project with a GUI and more detailed charting with financial indicators.*
